I always avoided installing fonts on linux because it seemed so scary, and one of the _few_ things I liked about windows was that I could quickly install any font just by opening it and clicking install, which something I didn't get in my minimal arch linux build. so I had to either look up the font on the AUR (Arch User Repositories) or simply give up on using it. after some research, I realised that **installing fonts manually through the terminal is waaay easier then the traditional windows way !**

Let's get started !

first download the font you want. I recommend [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) or [Font squirrel](https://fontsquirrel.com/), usually the font comes as a .zip file, run **unzip** to extract it. here is an example

```bash
unzip JetbrainsMono.zip
```

to actually _install_ the font, you only need to move it to where it should be, in most linux distro's that is `/usr/share/fonts` but you can check that by running the `fc-list` command, that will list the path to every font you have installed on your system, it will look something like this.

```
...
/usr/share/fonts/noto/NotoLoopedLao-Thin.ttf: Noto Looped Lao,Noto Looped Lao Thin:style=Thin,Regular
/usr/share/fonts/noto/NotoSerifDevanagari-Regular.ttf: Noto Serif Devanagari:style=Regular
/usr/share/fonts/noto/NotoRashiHebrew-Black.ttf: Noto Rashi Hebrew,Noto Serif Hebrew Blk:style=Black,Regular
/usr/share/fonts/noto/NotoSerifTangut-Regular.ttf: Noto Serif Tangut:style=Regular
...
```
notice how each font starts with /usr/share/fonts

so now simply move the extracted folder to your fonts folder using the `mv` command, you may need root permissions

```bash
sudo mv JetbrainsMono /usr/share/fonts/
```

> it does not matter if fonts are directly inside the fonts folder or in a folder inside there, but generally if you want a clean system multiple folders are recommended

and that's it now to make sure you have the font, you can once again use fc-list but with the **grep** command to filter down the results

```bash
fc-list | grep JetbrainsMono
```

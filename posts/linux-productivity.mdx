unlike some popular opinions, you can be very productive when using linux, in this guide I'll show you how !

## Linux is not good for you if...
- You absolutly need to play every new game that comes out
> it is important to note that with Valve's proton 75% of games work perfectly with no workarounds in linux, only some competitive online games arent available
- you need Adobe products and you can't use an alternative for some reason

now that is out of the way, let's get started.

once you are done with this guide, you will have a **privacy respecting customized system that is fully controlled by your keyboard** (you can actually ditch your mouse !).

## Requirments
- A usb stick with 4Gb or more storage
- internet connection
## Setting up a bootable USB
### getting the ISO
the first step is to get the ISO and burn it into our USB stick, open the <a href="https://archlinux.org/download" target="_blank">download page for arch linux</a> and scroll down then select the closest server to you. you will get a table showing different installation files for arch, click the one that ends with `x86_64.iso`.
### burning the ISO into a USB stick
plug the USB stick into your pc, if you are in windows, you can use <a href="https://rufus.ie" target="_blank" >rufus</a>, install it and select the USB and ISO you just downloaded and click `start`.

## Installing arch linux
reboot your computer, make sure the USB is still plugged in, once the manifacurer's logo appears **click on each one of the Fn keys until the bios shows up**, each pc manifacturer uses a different key for entering the BIOS, I just click every key to avoid having to look it up. now move to the `boot` tab, you should see a list different bootable devices move the one that correspondes to your USB to the top of the list. finally save and exit the BIOS.

### Internet Connection
if you have a cable connection, internet should work fine if you use wifi I'll go over how to get your wifi setup
> to check if you have internet or not, run `ping google.com` if multiple results are returned then you have internet and you can move on.

in case internet is not working for you run `iwctl` then run the following commands replacing `device` with the device you got from the first command and `SSID` with your network name.
```bash
device list
station device scan
station device get-networks
station device connect SSID
```
> The user interface supports autocomplete, by typing station and `Tab` `Tab`, the available devices are displayed, type the first letters of the device and `Tab` to complete. The same way, type connect and `Tab` `Tab` in order to have the list of available networks displayed. Then, type the first letters of the chosen network followed by `Tab` in order to complete the command.

### use archfi to install arch quickly
run the following command to install archfi, the installer script we are going to use for this guide.
```bash
curl -L archfi.sf.net/archfi > archfi
```

then run this to launch it
```bash
sh archfi
```
from here, I think most people can go through each option and select what they need. but in case you get stuck, techhut made a great video about archfi, go check that out !
**if you want to make the most out of linux, do not install a Desktop Environment** we will use a tilling window manager instead

once that done, you should be able to reboot into your arch install, if you get a login screen then everything should be good

### Larbs, the secret componenent
larbs is a bootstrapping script, with it you get a fully fledged tilling window manager, with keyboards shortcuts, the installation should not take about 15 minutes and you will be ready to go.
to get started run this to install larbs
```bash
sudo curl -LO larbs.xyz/larbs.sh
```
then run this to launch it
```bash
sudo sh larbs.sh
```
when asked for your username, if you created a use with archfi, enter it here, if not pick a name for your new user and its password. the rest of the installation is automatic

and that's it, once you reboot and log in, your system should be up and running ! here is how it should look like

## A few tips and tricks
- press `Windows+F1` to launch a PDF that covers most of what larbs can do
- press `Windows+enter` to open a terminal, you can practiclly launch any program from there
- press `Windows+d` to launch dmenu where you can type the name of a program to launch it
- `Windows+WORKSPACE_NUMBER` to switch to that workspace
- `windows+j` or `windows+k` to move between windows
- `windows+h` or `windows+l` to resize windows
- and finally `windows+shift+WORKSPACE_NUMBER` will move the selected window to that workspace

That was it, thanks for reading and have a good day !

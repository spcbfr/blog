I watched a luke smith video where he compared different classic thinkpad models and I basically fell in love and I knew I had to get one for myself

After a bit of research and looking around, I found this local **thinkpad t420** for 170 bucks with the following specs
 - intel i5 2nd generation
 - 8GB of ram
 - 500 Gb of storage (HDD)

now to be honest, these specs arent the best and the price is too high but that was the only option, so I ordered it and this badboy came in

now after a bit over a month of using it I concluded my opinion:

## Screen
the screen has a TN panel which is know to be horrible compared to the IPS screen found in basically every modern laptop. when the laptop first came in it had windows 7 installed and the brightness was changing randomly every now and then, I thought that was a problem with the TN panel and I had to live with it. but once I installed linux on the machine this problem was fixed

over time I got used to how the TN screen looks and now it looks fine for me ! in case you can't live with the TN panel you can always replace it with the modern IPS panel if you want to

## Keyboard and trackpoint
the classic keyboard and the trackpoint (sometimes called pointing stick) are the thinkpad's trademark and they are very good, the 7-row Keyboard keyboard is way more comfortable than the chicklet one, and the trackpoint is great for precise movements, the texture on the trackpoint is not the best but it can be replaced.
## Linux
this computer has the *best support for linux I have ever seen*, I am running arch linux but I have seen people run all sorts of things on this, from PopOS to gentoo to BSD. I didnt face any major issues, both the thinkLight and trackpoint worked great out of the box

aaand that was it, overall the T420 is a great machine and it is not going away anytime soon !
